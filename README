GPUSVM, version 0.2

This software is an implementation of Support Vector Machine training
and classification using Nvidia Graphics Processors.  The software
builds under linux, with gcc 4.4.3 and nvcc 3.2. 

The build process assumes that cuda is installed in /usr/local/cuda,
and that the CUDA SDK is installed at ~/cuda.  If this is not the
case, set your CUDA_INSTALL_PATH and CUDA_SDK_PATH variables
appropriately.

Also, if you are compiling this for Fermi devices, make sure to set
your SMVERSIONFLAGS environment variable to "-arch sm_20".  We have
seen unexplained segmentation faults when running this code compiled
for earlier architectures on Fermi devices.

Please report bugs and problems to bcatanzaro@nvidia.com or
narayans@eecs.berkeley.edu.
